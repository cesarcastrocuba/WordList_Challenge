## Assignment

Write a console application that processes a word list. The application should print all the 6-letter words from the list, that can be obtained by concatenating two other words from the list.

An example: The word &quot;albums&quot; is printed, because the words &quot;al&quot;, &quot;bums&quot; and &quot;albums&quot; are in the word list.

Print the result as follows:

al + bums =\&gt; albums

bar + ely =\&gt; barely

be + foul =\&gt; befoul

con + vex =\&gt; convex

here + by =\&gt; hereby

jig + saw =\&gt; jigsaw

tail + or =\&gt; tailor

we + aver =\&gt; weaver

#### **Remarks**

- The word list is in the wordlist.txt file, located on your desktop.
- Pay special attention to the readability of your code, as well as the extendibility/flexibility.
- Make sure that the performance of your solution is acceptable.
- Use OO principles.
- Optional: Initialise a local git repository and indicate your progress by using small commits.
- Optional: TDD.

#### **Timing**

- Expected duration: 45 min.
- We&#39;ll check every 15 minutes, to see how things are going.
- Not finished? No problem. The main focus of this assignment is to get an idea of your method of problem solving, and of your code style. Make sure that what you are coding, is something you are proud of.
